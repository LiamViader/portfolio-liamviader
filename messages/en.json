I enjoy reflecting on all kinds of topics —from philosophical questions to thoughts about art or technology— and I think this constant curiosity says a lot about who I am.",
        "second": "So even in my free time I keep creating. Sometimes I write or sketch, other times I design imaginary systems or small software projects I want to play around with. I'm not always aiming for something tangible —sometimes it's just about exploring an idea.",
        "third": "But sometimes being so mentally active wears me out, and I need to move to disconnect. I love walking —through the city, in the mountains, or across the fields and hills just outside where I live—; sometimes it's just a quick walk to recharge and clear my head, and other times I take my time, wandering aimlessly and discovering new places that surprise me. I like being there when the sun starts to fade and the sky shifts in color. I also go to the gym, go for a run, or take the bike out; those are the moments when I let my body take the lead and my mind can finally slow down a little.",
        "fourth": "I also find inspiration in quieter moments. I enjoy reading —from books on programming, artificial intelligence, or system design to philosophy essays or fantasy fiction— and sometimes getting lost in a good video game. Both help me learn, get inspired, and discover new ways of thinking and creating.",
        "fifth": "And in the middle of all this are Neo and Iris —my cat and my dog— who sometimes sneak into my photos without warning."
